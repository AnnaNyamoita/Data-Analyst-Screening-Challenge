# Data-Analyst-Screening-Challenge

This repository contains the analysis and insights for the Data Analyst Screening Challenge. It demonstrates the analysis of healthcare data, including outpatient and inpatient charges, along with ICD-10 diagnosis data. The work was completed using Python for data analysis and Tableau for data visualization.

## Project Overview

1. Calculating average outpatient and inpatient Medicare payments.
2. Performing a time series analysis on different APC services.
3. Conducting geographical analysis based on state-level data for affordable providers.
4. Analyzing the top 10 prominent inpatient ICD-10 diagnoses based on state and their ICD-10 Chapter and Block descriptions.

## Contents
